# Senior PHP developer :mag:
Hello there, you are looking for a new place to share and grow your code ideas.
We are a team of the most boring software engineers you'll ever meet. Except that we are not.
We love our work, and we mean we LOVE our work.
Except that legacy project we don't like. And you will not like it too.

## What languages makes you forget about time? :nerd_face:
We use PHP in our day to day code adventures. We use PHP ~7.1 We are not limited to it
though. Use best tool for the job someone once said.
Everyday we argue about Symfony over Laravel, still we don't have the
answer. Maybe we could try something cooler? Or even create something better?

## You know about data storage right? :zap:
To store and query our data we mostly use PostgreSQL and of course
we support some MySQL too.

Instead of mongo we use `> /dev/null` it's more consistent

## Do you have a moment to talk about linux? :penguin:
``` bash
vim ./answer

:i

Yes!

:wq!
```

## Cloud what? :cloud:
```
By the year 2030, there will be two jobs left:

• Coal miner
• Jeff Bezos
```

Currently we work mostly with AWS. We love the little whale :whale: and 
we are trying to make it work efficiently on Mac.

## How are you sure your code works? :construction_worker:
We are driven by the domain. Or it was domain driven.
In any case we are DDD. We explore and adjust using TDD and BDD.
Don't know what these caps lock letters mean?

*DDD* - http://lmgtfy.com/?q=DDD

*BDD* - http://lmgtfy.com/?q=BDD

*TDD* - http://lmgtfy.com/?q=TDD

But you should already know that.

## TL;DR Apply now :love_letter:
